- Building predictive models

Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing the **Master of Data Science in Computational Linguistics (MDS-CL)** at **UBC**, where I focus on **natural language processing (NLP)** and **language technologies**. This program allows me to combine my data science background with a deeper understanding of how machines can interpret and process human language.
